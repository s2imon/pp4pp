Core to this site are several guides for adding the privacy policies to the app stores:

How to add a privacy policy to the App Store [pp4pp/ios-guide.html](http://s2imon.github.io/pp4pp/ios-guide.html)

How to add a privacy policy to the Play Store [pp4pp/play-guide.html](http://s2imon.github.io/pp4pp/play-guide.html)

How to add a privacy policy to the Windows Phone [pp4pp/wp-guide.html](http://s2imon.github.io/pp4pp/wp-guide.html)



## Minimum requirements for a mobile privacy policy

- who they are (identity and contact details),
- what precise categories of personal data the app wants to collect and process,
- why the data processing is necessary (for what precise purposes),
- whether data will be disclosed to third parties (not just a generic but a specific description to whom the data will be disclosed),
- what rights users have, in terms of withdrawal of consent and deletion of data;
